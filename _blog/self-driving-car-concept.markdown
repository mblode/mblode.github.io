A screenshot of my progress while drawing a side-view of the vehicle in Adobe Photoshop. I draw in black and white so it is easier to colour the body once I'm done which allows me to test variations.

Finalised drawing of the Tesla Model A concept.

Initial export from Autodesk Maya using the Arnold Renderer. The 3D render looks bare bones and I decided to make changes using Photoshop for fixing up any issues.

After adding lens flares, glows, an emblem, rear lights, a grill, many corrections and a backdrop, the concept car is finally complete.
